# Ganga Acharya — Personal Portfolio

Welcome to the source code for my personal portfolio website. This is a place where I showcase my skills, projects, and share a little more about myself. Built with React and Tailwind CSS, the site is fully responsive and optimized for performance.

## 🌐 Live Site

You can view the live site here: [https://gangacharya.com](https://gangacharya.com)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- React
- Tailwind CSS
- React Icons
- EmailJS (for contact form)

## 📁 How It's Organized

The project is organized in a way that keeps things tidy and easy to manage:

- **assets/** – for images, PDFs, and other files
- **components/** – where all the sections of the website live (like Navbar, About, Projects, etc.)
- **hooks/** – for small pieces of logic that are reused
- **App.js** – the main layout of the site
- **index.js** – the first file the browser looks at to start the app

## ✨ Features

- Dynamic dark/light/system theme switcher
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Accessible, responsive layout
- Modular and reusable components
- Resume download/view and contact form with email support

## 🚧 What's Next

This portfolio is always a work in progress. I'm planning to:

- Add a blog section
- Keep updating the "What I've Built" section as I work on more projects
- Refine animations and improve overall performance
